This gateway daemon establishes a VPN tunnel between NodePools, while the other daemons within the same NodePool set up cross-NodePool network routing rules to direct traffic through this gateway node.\nAdditionally, Raven is designed to intercept only the traffic that needs to traverse between NodePools, allowing intra-NodePool traffic to continue using the native CNI network solution.\nThis means that Raven can integrate effortlessly with existing CNI network solutions such as Flannel, Calico, and others.
