title: Yurt-Coordinator Performance Test
---

## Background

Yurt-Coordinator is an important component in edge node pool. OpenYurt uses Yurt-Coordinator to select a yurthub master and backup the resources in edge node pool.

In this article, we test the performance of Yurt-Coordinator pod and give a suggestion resource configuration.

## Test Method

* Start the Yurt-Coordinator pod and record the beginning resource used.
* Write a mount of resources and record the resource used of Yurt-Coordinator. In this test, we write 1000 pods and 500 nodes into Yurt-Coordinator. The size of each pod and node both are 8KB.
* Delete all resources in Yurt-Coordinator. To see whether resource used will go down to the beginning level.
* Rewrite a mount of resources to Yurt-Coordinator and patch them frequently and randomly. Check the resource used of current situation.
* Check the result of leader election.

### Phase five

Run other program to do leader election and check the result. 

Go code run 500 goroutines and every goroutine do the same things to acquire leader. After acquiring leader successfully, go client sleep 1 second and quit.

We can see that program acquired leader successfully. After one client quited, the other go client can aquire leader successfully.

```

Check the lease resource in Yurt-Coordinator. We can see the lease resource and the holder of lease changes periodically.

```shell
$ kubectl get lease
NAME        HOLDER                                 AGE
test-lock   ff43ffde-3551-47d6-b2af-1fa3ef115b86   5m

$ kubectl get lease
NAME        HOLDER                                 AGE
test-lock   76870bb5-eaa0-44b0-a8a8-203c36a2d373   5m

$ kubectl get lease
NAME        HOLDER                                 AGE
test-lock   b127e7bc-beeb-474a-b0e9-5023b1563d94   5m

$ kubectl get lease
NAME        HOLDER                                 AGE
test-lock   7a4dd5d7-5e25-4f69-a882-d32e17bb703a   5m
```


## Conclusion

After testing, we got the minimum resource limit that Yurt-Coordinator needed: CPU 310m„ÄÅmemory 450MB.

And we see that deleting resource in etcd will not let the resource used of Yurt-Coordinator goes down.

It is caused by the storage mechanism of etcd, which will add tombstone revision instead of deleting resource immediately.

When patching resource frequently, the memory used of etcd go up. If we set the memory limit of etcd, it will cause etcd container OOM.

Finally, we got that CPU is not the limit resource of Yurt-Coordinator. And the memory used of etcd container should be limited to an acceptable level to protect other pod in edge node pool

So, in an edge node pool, when node number less than 500 and pod number less then 1000, we recommend the resource configuration below:

```yaml
apiserverResources:
  requests:
    cpu: 250m
---
etcdResources:
  limits:
    cpu: 200m
    memory: 512Mi
  requests:
    cpu: 100m
    memory: 256Mi
```
