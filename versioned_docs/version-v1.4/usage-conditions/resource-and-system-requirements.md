title: Resource and System Requirements
---

## Resource Requirements
We strongly recommend at least 2 CPUs and 4 GB RAM per worker node in production environment.
Any less in development environment is ok but will leave little room for your workloads.

## Tested Platforms
* CentOS 7.4+ (amd64 and arm64)
* Ubuntu 18.04 LTS+ (amd64 and arm64)
* Fedora 31 (amd64)
* Debian 9.1 (amd64)
* Raspbian„ÄÅRaspberry Pi OS, kernel version 4.19+ (arm64)

Other platforms may work well but are not tested in our production environment. Supplements to the list are welcome.
